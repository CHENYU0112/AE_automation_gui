Are you tired of playing the "create a new file format" game every time you need to store your measurement data?

üò© Ugh, so last season! Enter DLH5, the standardized data format built on HDF5 that's here to save you from
your file format fiascos! üíæ

With an API for reading, writing, and searching your data in a consistent and performant way,
DLH5 takes self-describing and standardized data storage to a whole new level.
üöÄ And don't even get me started on the types of result data it supports -
scalar numeric, string, array, waveform, array, file! ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Plus, with the ability to store measurement data for any amount of operating
conditions and add metadata to your file or data, DLH5 is the gift that keeps on giving.
üéÅ Built on top of the [h5py](https://www.h5py.org/) library
(which is pretty fantastic, if we do say so ourselves),
DLH5 puts the "fun" in functional. Okay, okay, maybe not, but it definitely puts the
"standard" in standardized data storage. ü§ì

So, what are you waiting for? Give DLH5 a try and start storing your measurement data like a pro! üí™



## Executable

In a hurry? üí® Then get the latest version of DLH5 for usage via CLI as an executable
[here](https://goto.infineon.com/pydocs/pypi-des-pyverify-local/ifx-dlh5?latest=pyapp)!

After downloading, you can run the executable by double-clicking it or by executing it in a terminal.
On the first start, the executable will bootstrap itself and install a Python interpreter with the necessary
dependencies. This might take a few minutes, but after that, it should be really fast.

To fully remove the installation files, just delete the folder
``%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\pyapp\data\ifx-dlh5\<some hash>\<version>``.

## Installation

‚ÑπÔ∏è We use telemetry to track usage.
Don't want to share this with us and help us make informed decisions? üò≠
Then opt-out, more info [here](https://goto/monocle).

**The sustainable way:**

Insert the following lines into your ``%APPDATA%\pip\pip.ini`` file (``$HOME/.config/pip/pip.conf`` on Linux)::

    [global]
    index-url = https://artifactory.intra.infineon.com/artifactory/api/pypi/pypi-innersource-vir/simple

``pip install ifx-dlh5``

**The painful-to-repeat way:**

``pip install ifx-dlh5 --index-url https://artifactory.intra.infineon.com/artifactory/api/pypi/pypi-innersource-vir/simple``
