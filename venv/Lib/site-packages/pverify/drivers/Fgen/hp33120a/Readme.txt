Notes:
-----

-   Overwrote default implmentation of hp33120a.IIviDriverUtility.IIviDriverUtility#Reset and hp33120a.IIviDriverUtility.IIviDriverUtility#ResetWithDefaults
    to not use the DLL function but the SCPI command "*RST".
    The default DLL implementation enables the output after the reset!
