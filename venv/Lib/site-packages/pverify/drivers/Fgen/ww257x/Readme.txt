WW-257X installed in: C:\Program Files\IVI Foundation\IVI\Drivers\ww257x or
C:\Program Files\IVI Foundation\VISA\WinNT\ww257x

WW-257X LabVIEW ver.x support installed in: C:\Program Files\National Instruments\LabVIEW ver.x\instr.lib\ww257x


-----------------------------------------------------------
2. Uninstalling the Instrument Driver
-----------------------------------------------------------

Open the Control Panel from the Start>>Settings menu and
double-click "Add/Remove Programs."
Select "WW-257X IVI Driver 1.1.28" from the list provided and
click the "Add/Remove" button.

Note: These software packages must be installed before driver installation:

- IVI Engine 2.0
- NI-VISA 4.0


-----------------------------------------------------------
3. Important Software Information
-----------------------------------------------------------


Products Supported
-------------------------------------------------------------

WW-257X version 1.1.28 supports the WW2571,WW2572,WW2571A,WW2572A,WW2074,WW1074,WW5064,TE5351,
PM8571,PM8572,WS8101,WS8102, PM8571A, PM8572A Waveform Generator.

This release supports the following Application Development
Environments: LabVIEW 2009 and above, CVI 2010 and above,
Matlab and Microsoft Visual C/C++ (MSVC).
To open the ww257x help file you need Internet Explorer 5.0
or later.


Getting Started with Your Software
-------------------------------------------------------------
WW-257X version 1.1.28 ships with several examples for LabVIEW, CVI,
Microsoft Visual C/C++ and Visual Basic. These examples will aid
you in developing your software and illustrate how to perform the
most common operations with your hardware.

The following examples are available:

-Function Generator--Generates standard waveforms

-Sweep Generator--Demonstrates how to use a function generator
                  to generate a frequency sweep

-Arbitrary Waveform--Generates an arbitrary waveform given a
                     single waveform buffer

-Arbitrary Sequence--Demonstrates how to create arbitrary sequence

-Pattern--Demonstrates how to load the data from the specified Digital data file.


Using the Examples in LabVIEW
------------------------------------------------------------
The LabVIEW examples are located in the ww257x.llb library in
the <labview>\instr.lib\ww257x directory.

The ww257x.llb is compiled for LabVIEW 2009.

There are several forms of help available for these examples.
For an overall description of the purpose of the example,
select VI Information in the Windows menu for the
VI.  For help on individual front panel controls, activate
the LabVIEW help window by selecting Show Help in the Help
menu.  Place the cursor over the control for which you want more
information.  For help on individual WW-257X 1.1.28 VIs called in
the examples, place the cursor over the VIs on
the example diagram with the help window activated.


Using the Examples in CVI
------------------------------------------------------------
To use an example in CVI, open the project file for the example
you want to run.  The project files are in the ww257x\examples\cvi
directory in the IVI directory.

The source code for these examples is heavily documented, and
all input and output values are documented to facilitate
changing the code to perform different acquisitions.

Individual function calls used in the examples are documented
in the Function Panels for WW-257X, which can be found under
the Instrument menu.  If the instrument is not loaded, load
..\ww257x\ww257x.fp from the VXIPNP directory.


Using the Examples in Microsoft Visual C/C++
----------------------------------------------------------------
To use an example in MSVC, open this Examples_MSVC.dsw project file
are in the ..\ww257x\examples\msvc directory in the VXIPNP directory.

The source code for these examples is heavily documented, and
all input and output values are documented to facilitate
changing the code to perform different acquisitions.

Using the Examples in Matlab
----------------------------------------------------------------
Matlab wrapper <tabor_ww257x.mdd> was created in Matlab 2013 and
is located in the  ..\ww257x\examples\matlab directory.


Using the Examples in Microsoft Visual Basic
----------------------------------------------------------------
To use an example in Visual Basic, open the project file (.vbp) of
the example you want to run.  The project files are in the
..\ww257x\examples\vb directory in the VXIPNP directory.

These examples are intended to provide a quick primer for using
WW-257X in Visual Basic.  Refer to the C and LabVIEW examples for
a more thorough treatment on using WW-257X.

When developing applications with Visual Basic that use WW-257X,
be sure to include the TABOR WW257X Waveform Generator
library as one of the references of your project.
