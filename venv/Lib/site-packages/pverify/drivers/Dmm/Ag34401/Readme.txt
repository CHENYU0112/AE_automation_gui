Version 1.2.5.0		April 2013

Introducing the Agilent34401 IVI Driver for the Agilent 34401A Digital Multi Meter
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This instrument driver provides access to the functionality of
  Agilent34401 through a COM server or ANSI C API which also complies with
  the IVI specifications. This driver works in any development environment
  which supports COM or C programming including Microsoft Visual C++, Microsoft .NET,
  Agilent VEE Pro, National Instruments LabView, LabWindows CVI, MATLAB(32 bit only) and others.


Supported Instruments
---------------------
  34401A


Installation
-------------
  System Requirements: The driver installation will check for the
  following requirements.  If not found, the installer will either
  abort, warn, or install the required component as appropriate.

  Supported Operating Systems:
    Windows XP
    Windows Vista
    Windows 7

  Shared Components
    Before this driver can be installed, your computer must already
    have the IVI Shared Components installed.

    Minimal IVI Version: 2.1.1

    The IVI Shared Components installer is available from:
    http://www.ivifoundation.org/shared_components/Default.aspx

  VISA-COM
    Any compliant implementation is acceptable. Typically, VISA-COM is
    installed with VISA and other I/O library modules.  The latest version
	of Agilent's IO Libraries is recommended and includes VISA-COM.
    You can download the latest version from:
      http://www.agilent.com/find/iosuite


Uninstall
---------
  This driver can be uninstalled like any other software from the
  Control Panel using "Add or Remove Programs" in Win XP or
  "Programs and Features" in Windows Vista/Windows 7.

  The IVI Shared Components may also be uninstalled like any other
  software from the Control Panel using "Add or Remove Programs" in Win XP
  and "Program & Features" in Windows Vista/Windows 7.

  Note: All IVI-COM/C drivers require the IVI Shared Components to
  function. To completely remove IVI components from your computer,
  uninstall all drivers and then uninstall the IVI Shared Components.


Source Code
-----------
  Driver source code is available by choosing "Custom" and selecting
  "Source Code" when installing the driver.  This code is provided as
  is for informational purposes only.  Modification of this code is
  not supported.

  Caution: Once you have installed version 2.x of the IVI Shared Components,
  you will not be able to build IVI drivers and applications developed with earlier
  versions. You will need to upgrade those drivers/applications to the new IVI Shared
  Components and to build on Visual Studio 2008 or higher or you will need to build
  those drivers/applications on a different machine that does not have version 2.x
  of the IVI Shared Components.


Start Menu Help File
--------------------
  A shortcut to the driver help file is added to the Start Menu,
  All Programs, Agilent IVI Drivers, Agilent34401 group.  It contains
  "Getting Started" information on using the driver in a variety of programming
  environments as well as documentation on IVI and instrument specific
  methods and properties.

  You will also see shortcuts to the Readme file and many programming
  examples for this driver.


Additional Setup
----------------
  .NET Framework
   The .NET Framework itself is not required by this driver. If you
   plan to use the driver with .NET, the minimal .NET framework version is: 2.0

  The .NET Framework requires an interop assembly for a COM server. A Primary
  Interop Assembly, along with an XML file for IntelliSense is installed with
  the driver. The driver's PIA along with IVI PIAs are installed by default in:
 <drive>:\Program Files <(x86)>\IVI Foundation\IVI\Bin\Primary Interop Assemblies

  The PIA is also installed into the Global Assembly Cache (GAC) if
  you have the .NET framework installed.


Using a New Version of the Driver
---------------------------------
  New versions of this Agilent IVI-COM/C driver may have a new
  ProgId.

  If you use the version dependent ProgId in CoCreateInstance,
  you will need to modify and recompile your code to use the
  new ProgID once you upgrade to the next version of the driver.
  Doing a side-by-side installation of the driver to use multiple
  versions of the driver is not supported.  If you need to go back
  to an older version of the driver, you need to uninstall the later
  version and install the older version.

  If you use the version independent ProgId in CoCreateInstance,
  you will not need to modify and recompile your code.  The new
  version of the driver has been tested to be backwards compatible
  with previous versions.

  To access the new functionality in a new version of the driver
  you will need to use the latest numbered IAgilent34401[n]
  interface rather than the IAgilent34401 interface.  The
  IAgilent34401[n].<interface> property will return a pointer
  to the new IAgilent34401<interface>[n] interface.  The
  IAgilent34401<interface>[n] interface contains the methods and
  properties for the new functionality.  The new interfaces were
  introduced rather than modifying the existing interfaces for
  backwards compatibility.  The interfaces that were previously
  shipped have not been changed.

  Pre-existing .NET client applications must be re-build before using the new
  version of the driver.


Known Issues
------------
  This driver does not have any known defects.
