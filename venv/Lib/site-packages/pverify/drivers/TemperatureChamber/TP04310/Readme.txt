  Introduction:

  This instrument driver provides programming support for TP04310.
  It contains functions for opening, configuring, taking measurements from, and
  closing the instrument.

________________________________________________________________________________

  Assumptions:

  To successfully use this module, the following conditions must be met:

  For GPIB instrument drivers:
         -  the instrument is connected to the GPIB.
         -  the GPIB address supplied to the initialize function must match the
            GPIB address of the instrument.

  For VXI instrument drivers:
         -  the instrument is installed in the VXI mainframe and you are
            using one of the following controller options:
                  Embedded controller
                  MXI
                  MXI2
                  GPIB-VXI
         -  the logical address supplied to the initialize function must
            match the logical address of the instrument.

  For RS-232 instrument drivers:
         -  the instrument is connected to the RS-232 interface.
         -  the COM port, baud rate, parity, and timeout supplied to the
            initialize function must match the settings of the instrument.

________________________________________________________________________________

  Error and Status Information:

  Each function in this instrument driver returns a status code that
  either indicates success or describes an error or warning condition.
  Your program should examine the status code from each call to an
  instrument driver function to determine if an error occurred.
  The general meaning of the status code is as follows:

       Value                  Meaning
       -------------------------------
       0                      Success
       Positive Values        Warnings
       Negative Values        Errors

  The description of each instrument driver function lists possible error
  codes and their meanings

                             ViBoolean resetDevice, ViInt32 baudRate,
                             ViInt16 parity, ViInt32 timeout,
                             ViPSession instrumentHandle);

  Purpose

      This function performs the following initialization actions:

      - Opens a session to the Default Resource Manager resource and a session
      to the specified device using the interface and address specified in the
      Resource_Name control.

      - Performs an identification query on the Instrument.

      - Resets the instrument to a known state.

      - Sends initialization commands to the instrument that set any necessary
      programmatic variables such as Headers Off, Short Command form, and Data
      Transfer Binary to the state necessary for the operation of the
      instrument driver.

      - Returns an Instrument Handle which is used to differentiate between
      different sessions of this instrument driver.

      - Each time this function is invoked a Unique Session is opened.  It is
      possible to have more than one session open for the same resource.



  Parameter List

      resourceName

          Variable Type       ViRsrc

          This control specifies the interface and address of the device that
          is to be initialized (Instrument Descriptor). The exact grammar to be
          used in this control is shown in the note below.

          Default Value:  "GPIB::1"

          Notes:

          (1) Based on the Instrument Descriptor, this operation establishes a
          communication session with a device.  The grammar for the Instrument
          Descriptor is shown below.  Optional parameters are shown in square
          brackets ([]).

          Interface   Grammar
          ------------------------------------------------------
          GPIB        GPIB[board]::primary address[::secondary address]
                      [::INSTR]

          The GPIB keyword is used with GPIB instruments.

          The default value for optional parameters are shown below.

          Optional Parameter          Default Value
          -----------------------------------------
          board                       0
          secondary address           none - 31


      IDQuery

          Variable Type       ViBoolean

          This control specifies if an ID Query is sent to the instrument
          during the initialization procedure.

          Valid Range:
          VI_OFF (0) - Skip Query
          VI_ON  (1) - Do Query (Default Value)

          Notes:

          (1) Under normal circumstances the ID Query ensures that the
          instrument initialized is the type supported by this driver. However
          circumstances may arise where it is undesirable to send an ID Query
          to the instrument.  In those cases; set this control to "Skip Query"
          and this function will initialize the selected interface, without
          doing an ID Query.

          /**** DELETE THIS NOTE AND THE STATUS CODE IF SUPPORTED *****/
          (2) If this instrument does not support an ID Query, and this control
          is set to "Do Query" then this function should return the Warning
          Code 0x3FFC0101 - VI_WARN_NSUP_ID_QUERY.


      resetDevice

          Variable Type       ViBoolean

          This control specifies if the instrument is to be reset to its
          power-on settings during the initialization procedure.

          Valid Range:
          VI_OFF (0) - Don't Reset
          VI_ON  (1) - Reset Device (Default Value)

          Notes:

          (1) If you do not want the instrument reset. Set this control to
          "Don't Reset" while initializing the instrument.

          /**** DELETE THIS NOTE AND THE STATUS CODE IF SUPPORTED *****/
          (2) If this instrument does not support a Reset, and this control is
          set to "Reset Device" then this function should return the Warning
          Code 0x3FFC0102 - VI_WARN_NSUP_RESET.

          This control returns an Instrument Handle that is used in all
          subsequent function calls to differentiate between different sessions
          of this instrument driver.

          Notes:

          (1) Each time this function is invoked a Unique Session is opened.
          It is possible to have more than one session open for the same
          resource.

          Notes:

          (1) Parameter Error Codes for parameters 1 through 8 are defined in
          the vpptype.h header file the range is BFFC0001 - BFFC0008; Parameter
          Error Codes for parameters 9 through 15 are defined in the instrument
          driver's header file the range is BFFC0809 - BFFC080F; for parameter
          errors greater than 15, and other instrument specific error codes,
          use an error code in the range of BFFC0900 to BFFC0FFF.  This is
          equivalent to using (VI_ERROR_INSTR_OFFSET + n); where n represents
          each instrument specific error number.  Valid ranges for n are 0 to
          6FF.  (All values are given in Hexadecimal Notation)

          (2) Delete all unused status codes from the Status Control of each
          function panel when you are finished development of your instrument
          driver, for example in this control the status codes for parameters
          1, 3-8, and the codes for Error Opening and Writing to File should be
          deleted.  Those status codes are provided here as a convenience for
          during driver development.

          (3) Delete these three (3) notes when you are finished with your
          driver development.

  TP04310_readInstrData

      ViStatus TP04310_readInstrData (ViSession instrumentHandle,
                                      ViInt32 numberBytesToRead,
                                      ViChar _VI_FAR readBuffer[],
                                      ViPInt32 numBytesRead);

  Purpose

      This function reads data from the instrument's output buffer and returns
      it to the specified variable in memory.

      Notes:

      (1) Because the instrument may return both numeric and text data in
      response to queries this function returns the data in string format.

      (2) If valid data is not available at the instrument's output buffer when
      this function is called the instrument will hang up and the function will
      not return until it times out.  If the time-out is disabled this function
      will hang indefinitely and it may be necessary to reboot the computer to
      break out.

  Parameter List

      instrumentHandle

          Variable Type       ViSession

          This control accepts the Instrument Handle returned by the Initialize
          function to select the desired instrument driver session.

          Default Value:  None

      numberBytesToRead

          Variable Type       ViInt32

          The number of bytes specified by this control should be greater than
          or equal to the number of bytes which are to be read from the
          instrument. If the actual number of bytes to be read is greater than
          the number this control specifies then multiple reads will be
          required to empty the instrument's output buffer.

          If the instrument's output buffer is not emptied the instrument may
          return invalid data when future reads are performed.

          Default Value:  50 (See NOTE 2)

          Notes:

          (1) If NO DATA is available at the instrument's output buffer when
          this function is called the instrument will hang up and the function
          will not return until it times out.  If the time-out is disabled,
          this function will hang indefinitely and it may be necessary to
          reboot the computer.

          (2) If the number of bytes expected is greater than 50 the value of
          this control may be increased. If the actual number of bytes read is
          larger than the declared size of the read buffer a run-time error
          will be generated.


      readBuffer

          Variable Type       ViChar[]

          The incoming data from the instrument is placed into this variable.

          Notes:

          (1) Because the instrument may return both numeric and text data in
          response to queries this function returns the data in string format.

          (2) This function does not overwrite any old data left in the string
          variable from the last time the function was called. String data in
          LabWindows/CVI is terminated with an ASCII null(0x0) and string
          manipulation functions will only recognize data before the ASCII
          null.

          (3) The declared size of the string variable must be greater than the
          actual number of bytes read from the instrument if it is not a
          run-time error will be generated.


      numBytesRead

          Variable Type       ViInt32 (passed by reference)

          This variable contains the actual number of bytes read from the
          instrument. This is the value which is returned by the read function.

          Notes:

          (1) If the actual number of bytes read is less than the number of
          bytes specified in the Number Bytes To Read control then the output
          buffer has probably been emptied. If the read function fails and the
          number of bytes read is 0, the most probable cause for the failure is
          there was no data available at the instrument's output buffer.

  Return Value

          This control contains the status code returned by the function call.

          Status Codes:
