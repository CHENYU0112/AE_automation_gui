Version: 1.8.0.0		Dec 2020

Introducing the AgilentE36xx IVI Driver for the Keysight E3600 Series of Power Supplies
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This instrument driver provides access to the functionality of the
  AgilentE36xx through a COM server or ANSI C API which also complies
  with the IVI specifications. This driver works in any development environment
  which supports COM or C programming including Microsoft Visual C++, Microsoft
  .NET, Keysight VEE Pro, National Instruments LabView, LabWindows CVI, MATLAB(32
  bit only) and others.

Installation
-------------
  System Requirements: The driver installation will check for the following
  requirements.  If not found, the installer will either abort, warn, or
  install the required component as appropriate.

  Supported Operating Systems:
    Windows 7 32-bit, 64-bit
    Windows 8 32-bit, 64-bit
    Windows 10 32-bit, 64-bit

  Shared Components
    Before this driver can be installed, your computer must already have:
	  IVI Shared Components Version: 2.6.1 or newer installed

    The IVI Shared Components installers are available from:
    http://www.ivifoundation.org/shared_components/Default.aspx

  VISA-COM
    Any compliant implementation is acceptable. Typically, VISA-COM is installed
	with VISA and other I/O library modules.  The latest version of Keysight's IO
	Libraries is recommended and includes VISA-COM.
    You can download the latest version from:
      http://www.keysight.com/find/iosuite


Uninstall
---------
  This driver can be uninstalled like any other software from the Control Panel
  using "Add or Remove Programs" or "Programs and Features" dialog.

  The IVI Shared Components may also be uninstalled like any other software from
  the Control Panel using the "Add or Remove Programs" or "Program &
  Features" dialog.

  Note: All IVI-COM/C drivers require the IVI Shared Components to function. To
  completely remove IVI components from your computer, uninstall all drivers and
  then uninstall the IVI Shared Components.


Source Code
-----------
  Driver source code is available by enabling the "Source Code" option in the
  "Custom Setup" dialog when installing the driver.  This code is provided as
  is for informational purposes only.  Modification of this code is not
  supported.  Code is a Visual Studio 2010 C++ project and may be updated to new
  versions of Visual Studio.

  Caution: Once you have installed version 2.x of the IVI Shared Components,
  you will not be able to build IVI drivers and applications developed with
  earlier versions. You will need to upgrade those drivers/applications to the
  new IVI Shared Components and to build on Visual Studio 2010 or higher or you
  will need to build those drivers/applications on a different machine that does
  not have version 2.x of the IVI Shared Components.


Start Menu Help File
--------------------
  A shortcut to the driver help file is added to the Start Menu, All Programs,
  Keysight Instrument Drivers, IVI-COM-C Drivers, KtIviComDrvr group.  It contains
  "Getting Started"   information on using the driver in a variety of programming
  environments as   well as documentation on IVI and instrument specific  methods and
  properties.

  You will also see shortcuts to the Readme and Introduction files and
  programming examples for this driver.


Additional Setup
----------------
  .NET Framework
  The .NET Framework itself is not required by this driver. If you plan to use
  the driver with .NET, the minimal .NET framework version is: 2.0

  The .NET Framework requires an interop assembly for a COM server. A Primary
  Interop Assembly, along with an XML file for IntelliSense is installed with
  the driver. The driver's PIA along with IVI PIAs are installed by default in:
  drive:\<Program Files>\IVI Foundation\IVI\Bin\Primary Interop Assemblies

  The PIA is also installed into the Global Assembly Cache (GAC) if you have the
  .NET framework installed.


Using a New Version of the Driver
---------------------------------
  New versions of this Keysight IVI-COM/C driver may have a new ProgId.

  If you use the version dependent ProgId in CoCreateInstance, you will need to
  modify and recompile your code to use the new ProgID once you upgrade to the
  next version of the driver.  Doing a side-by-side installation of the driver
  to use multiple versions of the driver is not supported.  If you need to go
  back to an older version of the driver, you need to uninstall the later
  version and install the older version.

  If you use the version independent ProgId in CoCreateInstance, you will not
  need to modify and recompile your code.  The new version of the driver has
  been tested to be backwards compatible with previous versions.

  To access the new functionality in a new version of the driver you will need
  to use the latest numbered IKtIviComDrvr[n] interface rather than the IKtIviComDrvr
  interface.  The IKtIviComDrvr[n].<interface> property will return a pointer
  to the new IKtIviComDrvr<interface>[n] interface.  The IKtIviComDrvr<interface>[n]
  interface contains the methods and properties for the new functionality and
  inherits all prior interface functionality.  The new interfaces were
  introduced rather than modifying the existing interfaces for backwards
  compatibility.  The interfaces that were previously shipped have not been
  changed.

  Pre-existing .NET client applications must be re-build before using the new
  version of the driver.
