Supported Instruments
---------------------
Tektronix DPO/MSO/MDO 2000,3000 and 4000 Series Oscilloscopes

Installation
-------------
  System Requirements: The driver installation will check for the
  following requirements.  If not found, the installer will either
  abort, warn, or install the required component as appropriate.

  Supported Operating Systems:
    Windows 2000
    Windows XP
    Windows Vista
    Windows 7

  Shared Components
    Before this driver can be installed, your computer must already
    have the IVI Shared Components installed.

    Minimal IVI Shared Components Version: 2.0

    The IVI Shared Components installer can be downloaded from:
    http://www.ivifoundation.org/shared_components/Default.aspx



Additional Setup
----------------
  .NET Framework
    The .NET Framework itself is not required by this driver. If you
    plan to use the driver with .NET, the minimal .NET framework version is 2.0.

  The .NET Framework requires an interop assembly for a COM
  server. A Primary Interop Assembly, along with an XML file for
  IntelliSense is installed with the driver. The driver's PIA, along
  with IVI PIAs are installed, by default, in:
  <drive>:\Program Files\IVI Foundation\IVI\Bin\Primary Interop Assemblies

  The PIA is also installed into the Global Assembly Cache (GAC) if
  you have the .NET framework installed.
