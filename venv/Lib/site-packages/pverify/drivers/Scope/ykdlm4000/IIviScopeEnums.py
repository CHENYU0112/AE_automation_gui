    IviScopeMeasurementHigh

    IviScopeMeasurementLow
        The voltage that corresponds to 0% when using the reference levels. The oscilloscope calculates this
        value using either the min/max or histogram methods. The min/max method uses the minimum value found.
        The histogram method uses a common value found below the middle of the waveform. The units are Volts.

    IviScopeMeasurementAverage
        The arithmetic average in volts measured over the entire waveform. The units are Volts.

    IviScopeMeasurementWidthNeg

    IviScopeMeasurementOverShoot
        The relative waveform distortion that follows an edge transition.

        Overshoot = ------------------------------ X 100%
                              Amplitude

        where the local maximum is the maximum voltage of the signal in the first half of the time period that
        commences when the rising edge crosses the high reference level and concludes when the subsequent falling
        edge crosses the high reference level.-for the falling edge:

                     Voltage Low - local maximum
        Overshoot = ------------------------------ X 100%
                              Amplitude

        where the local minimum is the minimum value of the signal measured in the first half of the time period that
        commences when the falling edge crosses the low reference level and concludes when the subsequent rising edge
        crosses the low reference level.The instrument makes the measurement on the edge closest to the beginning of
        the waveform record. The units are the percentage of the signal amplitude.

    IviScopeMeasurementPreshoot
        The relative waveform distortion that precedes an edge transition.
        It is calculated using the following formula:-for the rising edge

                    Voltage Low - local maximum
        Preshoot = ----------------------------- X 100%
                              Amplitude
        where the local minimum is the minimum value of the signal measured in the second half of the time period
        that commences when the preceding falling edge crosses the low reference level and concludes when the rising
        edge crosses the low reference level.-for the falling edge:

                     local maximum - Voltage High
        Overshoot = ------------------------------ X 100%
                              Amplitude
        where the local maximum is the maximum voltage of the signal in the second half of the time period
        that commences when the preceding rising edge crosses the high reference level and concludes when the falling
        edge crosses the high reference level.The instrument makes the measurement on the edge closest to the
        beginning of the waveform record. The units are the percentage of the signal amplitude.
