Introducing the LeCroy IVI-COM/IVI-C Driver for LeCroy oscilloscopes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The instrument driver provides access to the functionality of the
  LeCroyScope through a COM server which also complies
  with the IVI specifications.  This driver works in any development environment which
  supports COM programming including Microsoft Visual Basic, Microsoft
  Visual C++, Microsoft .NET, Agilent VEE Pro, National Instruments LabVIEW, and others.
  The driver also works in IVI-C environements such as National Instruments LabWindows.


Supported Instruments
---------------------
All Windows-based instruments in the following families:
WaveRunner 6K and WaveRunner Xi series
WavePro 7K and 700Zi series
WaveSurfer 400 and WaveSurfer Xs series
WaveMaster
HornetRunner
HornetSurfer
JarvikRunner
JarvikSurfer
SuperJet
HDO4000
HDO6000

Installation
-------------
  System Requirements: The driver installation will check for the
  following requirements.  If not found, the installer will either
  abort, warn, or install the required component as appropriate.

  Supported Operating Systems:
    Windows 2000
    Windows XP
    Windows Vista

  VICP Passport
    In order to use the LeCroyScope IVI driver with a TCP/IP connection, you must install the
    LeCroy VICP Passport for NI-VISA.  You can download this component from the LeCroy website: www.lecroy.com.
    If you are communicating with the instrument via GPIB, installation of the LeCroy passport is not needed.

  Shared Components
    Before this driver can be installed, your computer must already
    have several components already installed. The easiest way to
    to install these other components is by running the IVI Shared
    Components installation package available from the IVI Foundation
    as noted below. It installs all the items mentioned below.

    IVI Shared Components version 2.0.0.0 or later.
      The driver installer requires these components. They must be
      installed before the driver installer can install the driver.

      The IVI Shared Components installer is available from:
      http://www.ivifoundation.org/shared_components

      To install, open or run the file: IviSharedComponents.msi

      If the driver installer exhibits problems with installing the IVI
      Shared Components, find the program IviSharedComponents.msi and
      Run the program. It is able to install many of the required system
      components, including Windows Installer 2.0.

  VISA
    Any compliant implementation is acceptable for GPIB connections.  For using the instrument
    over a TCP/IP connection, only NI-VISA is supported and the LeCroy VICP passport for NI-VISA
    must also be installed.  You can download the LeCroy VICP passport for NI-VISA at www.lecroy.com.


Additional Setup
----------------
  .NET Framework
    The .NET Framework itself is not required by this driver. If you
    plan to use the driver with .NET, Service Pack 2 is required.

  The .NET Framework requires an interop assembly for a COM
  server. A Primary Interop Assembly, along with an XML file for
  IntelliSense is installed with the driver. The driver's PIA, along
  with IVI PIAs are installed, by default, in:
  <drive>:\Program Files\IVI Foundation\IVI\Bin\Primary Interop Assemblies

  The PIA is also installed into the Global Assembly Cache (GAC) if
  you have the .NET framework installed.


Start Menu Shortcuts
--------------------
   A shortcut to the driver help file is added to the Start Menu,
   Programs, LeCroyScope group.  It contains "Getting
   Started" information on using the driver in a variety of programming
   environments as well as documentation on IVI and instrument specific
   methods and properties.

   You will also see shortcuts to the Readme file and any programming
   examples for this driver.


Help File
---------
  The help file (LeCroyScope.chm) is located in the directory:
   <drive>:\Program Files\IVI Foundation\IVI\Drivers\LeCroyScope


MSI Installer
-------------
   The installation package for the driver is distributed as an MSI 2.0
 file. You can install the driver by double-clicking on the file.
 This operation actually runs:
      msiexec /i LeCroyScope.msi

   You can run msiexec from a command prompt and utilize its many
   command line options. There are no public properties which can be
   set from the command line.


Uninstall
---------
  This driver can be uninstalled like any other software from the
  Control Panel using "Add or Remove Programs".

  To uninstall the IVI Shared Components you must use the IVI Cleanup
  Utility available from the IVI Foundation at:
   http://www.ivifoundation.org/

  Note: All IVI-COM drivers require the IVI Shared Components to
  function. To completely remove IVI components from your computer,
  uninstall all drivers then run the IVI Cleanup Utility. This utility
  does not remove any IVI drivers.
