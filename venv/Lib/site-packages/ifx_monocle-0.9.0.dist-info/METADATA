To ensure the longevity of our projects at Infineon, we can leverage telemetry
to track the usage of our libraries and identify which business units are utilizing them.
This data helps us to visualize the impact of our libraries, providing valuable insights for us and management
to make informed decisions and maintain the project's sustainability for the long term.

This library may be used to instrument your own libraries with telemetry to answer following questions:

* Which features of my library are used across IFX business units? How many unique users are there?
  How is the distribution across platforms? Do many users still use old versions of my library?
* How is my application performing? E.g. the typical execution time of a certain function.

The only personal information that may be tracked by this library are:

* **Business Unit**
* **Username**

  Your username will be [pseudonymized/hashed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonymization)
  and is used for the sole purpose of counting the number of unique users of your libraries.

‚ùåüëé Users may decide to **opt-out** and disable sending telemetry information by setting
the system-wide environment variable ``MONOCLE_DISABLE`` to any value.


**But why not [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/)?**

This library does not try to replace more professional solutions like [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/),
but only implements a very basic subset of its functionality, to greatly simplify the usage for the library developer
in terms of tracking and analytics by providing a very simple API.

Furthermore, the backend of this solution is very easy to maintain and setup, in contrast to OpenTelemetry.


## Installation

**The sustainable way:**

Insert the following lines into your ``%APPDATA%\pip\pip.ini`` file (``$HOME/.config/pip/pip.conf`` on Linux)::

    [global]
    index-url = https://artifactory.intra.infineon.com/artifactory/api/pypi/pypi-innersource-vir/simple

``pip install ifx-monocle``

For analytics: ``pip install ifx-monocle[analytics]``


**The painful-to-repeat way:**

``pip install ifx-monocle --index-url https://artifactory.intra.infineon.com/artifactory/api/pypi/pypi-innersource-vir/simple``

For analytics: ``pip install ifx-monocle[analytics] --index-url https://artifactory.intra.infineon.com/artifactory/api/pypi/pypi-innersource-vir/simple``
